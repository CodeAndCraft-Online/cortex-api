# Community System Improvements - Progress Tracker

**Branch**: `feature/community-improvements`
**Started**: 2025-09-29
**Completed**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

## Overview
Implementing missing CRUD operations for complete community (sub) management in the Cortex API.

## Current Community System State (Before Improvements)
- ✅ **Implemented**: Core subs functionality (create, join, leave, invite, accept)
- ✅ **Implemented**: Private/public sub support
- ✅ **Implemented**: Invitation system working
- ❌ **Missing**: Update sub operations (PATCH/PUT)
- ❌ **Missing**: Delete sub operations (DELETE)
- ❌ **Missing**: Management queries (list members, pending invites)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core CRUD Operations (High Priority)

#### 1. Update Sub Operation
**Endpoint**: `PATCH /sub/{subID}`
- **Handler**: `UpdateSub(c *gin.Context)`
- **Service**: `UpdateSub(subID, username string, updateRequest SubRequest) (*Sub, error)`
- **Repository**: `UpdateSub(subID, ownerID uint, updateRequest SubRequest) (*Sub, error)`
- **Requirements**:
  - Only sub owner can update
  - Allow updating: `description`, `private` flag
  - Prevent updating: `name`, `ownerID`, `created_at`
  - Validate input constraints

**Test Coverage Needed**:
- Handler: Success update, unauthorized access, invalid sub ID, not owner
- Service: Owner validation, field updates
- Repository: Database update operations

**Swagger Update**: Add new endpoint with proper annotations

#### 2. Delete Sub Operation
**Endpoint**: `DELETE /sub/{subID}`
- **Handler**: `DeleteSub(c *gin.Context)`
- **Service**: `DeleteSub(subID, username string) error`
- **Repository**: `DeleteSub(subID, ownerID uint) error`
- **Requirements**:
  - Only sub owner can delete
  - Cascade delete handled by DB foreign keys
  - Clean up memberships, posts, comments, votes

**Test Coverage Needed**:
- Handler: Success delete, unauthorized access, invalid sub ID
- Service: Owner validation
- Repository: Database delete with cascade

**Swagger Update**: Add delete endpoint

### Phase 2: Management Queries (Medium Priority)

#### 3. List Sub Members
**Endpoint**: `GET /sub/{subID}/members`
- **Handler**: `GetSubMembers(c *gin.Context)`
- **Service**: `GetSubMembers(subID, username string) ([]SubMemberResponse, error)`
- **Repository**: `GetSubMembers(subID string, userID uint) ([]SubMemberResponse, error)`
- **Requirements**:
  - Public subs: anyone can view
  - Private subs: only members/owners can view
  - Return member usernames and join dates

**Test Coverage Needed**:
- Public sub: members list accessible
- Private sub: access denied to non-members

#### 4. List Pending Invites
**Endpoint**: `GET /sub/{subID}/pending-invites`
- **Handler**: `GetPendingInvites(c *gin.Context)`
- **Service**: `GetPendingInvites(subID, username string) ([]InviteResponse, error)`
- **Repository**: `GetPendingInvites(subID string, ownerID uint) ([]InviteResponse, error)`
- **Requirements**:
  - Only sub owners can view
  - Return pending invites with invitee usernames and created dates

**Test Coverage Needed**:
- Owner can view invites
- Non-owners get access denied

### Phase 3: Integration & Validation

#### 5. Route Registration
- Add new routes to `internal/routes/subs/subs.go`
- Ensure proper middleware application

#### 6. Data Models
- Add response DTOs as needed:
  - `SubMemberResponse`
  - `InviteResponse`
  - Update `SubResponse` if needed

#### 7. Comprehensive Testing
- All new handlers: unit tests with httptest
- All new services: integration tests
- All new repositories: database integration tests
- Update existing coverage to maintain 47%+ level

#### 8. Swagger Documentation
- Update docs with all new endpoints
- Regenerate swagger.json/yaml
- Ensure API documentation is complete

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All CRUD operations implemented (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [ ] Proper authorization on all owner-only operations
- [ ] Complete test coverage for new features
- [ ] Updated Swagger documentation
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] All tests passing

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core CRUD Operations
- [x] Update Sub Handler ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Update Sub Service ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Update Sub Repository ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Delete Sub Handler ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Delete Sub Service ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Delete Sub Repository ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 2: Management Queries
- [x] List Members Handler ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] List Members Service ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] List Members Repository ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] List Pending Invites Handler ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] List Pending Invites Service ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] List Pending Invites Repository ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 3: Integration & Validation
- [x] Route registration updates ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Response DTOs implemented ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Handler tests implemented ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Service tests implemented ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Repository tests implemented ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Swagger documentation updated ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] Full integration testing ✅ READY

## Notes & Decisions
- **Security**: Maintaining existing access control patterns
- **Performance**: Using existing query patterns, adding indexes if needed
- **Consistency**: Following established code patterns from other handlers/services
- **Testing**: Dockertest for database integration, httptest for HTTP layer
- **Documentation**: Complete Swagger annotations on all new endpoints

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Adding endpoints following existing patterns
- **Low Risk**: All operations test-covered before commit
- **Medium Risk**: Database cascade behavior (foreign keys handle this)
- **Low Risk**: No breaking changes to existing APIs
